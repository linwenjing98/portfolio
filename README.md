# Wen Jing's Data Analytics Portfolio 
## About
___
Hello! I’m Wen Jing, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in Industrial Systems Engineering and a minor in Business Analytics from the National University of Singapore. 

While my current role as a Cloud Security Engineering Analyst involves managing vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance, my enduring passion for data analytics has led me to consistently seek ways to integrate data-driven solutions into my work. I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights that can drive impactful decisions. Despite my experiences not being solely focused on analytics, I have dedicated time to honing my skills in data analysis, working with tools like Python and SQL, and applying them to solve problems in real-world scenarios. I actively pursue online courses to further enhance my capabilities and stay up-to-date with the latest data analytics techniques. 

Through my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my capability to analyze, interpret, and present data effectively, and I’m excited to continue this journey in a role where I can make data-driven contributions!


## Portfolio Projects
___
In this section, I will showcase some of the data analytics project that I have worked on. 

### Machine Learning Project on Heart Disease Prediction
**Code:** [Heart Disease Prediction.html](./Heart_Disease_Prediction.html)

**Description:** This project aims to predict the potential presence of heart related diseases in patients accurately based on other variables available such as the past medical histories, age, general physical and mental health, and more. 

**Methodolgy:** Several classification models were implemented and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, XGB Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Voting Class Ensemble. To address class imbalance in the dataset, advanced resampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), SMOTEENN (a combination of SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbors), and Class Weighing were applied.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data preprocessing, data modelling, hyperparameter tuning, model evaulation

**Results:** Achieving a 76.9% recall rate, the model effectively identified the majority of patients with heart-related diseases before any medical checkups or diagnoses. Analysis of feature weights revealed that general health, age, walking capability, smoking history, and past medical conditions are key indicators of heart disease.
