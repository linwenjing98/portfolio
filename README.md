# Wen Jing's Data Analytics Portfolio 
## About
Hello! I’m Wen Jing, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in Industrial Systems Engineering and a minor in Business Analytics from the National University of Singapore. 

While my current role as a Cloud Security Engineering Analyst involves managing vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance, my enduring passion for data analytics has led me to consistently seek ways to integrate data-driven solutions into my work. I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights that can drive impactful decisions. Despite my experiences not being solely focused on analytics, I have dedicated time to honing my skills in data analysis, working with tools like Python and SQL, and applying them to solve problems in real-world scenarios. I actively pursue online courses to further enhance my capabilities and stay up-to-date with the latest data analytics techniques. 

Through my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my capability to analyze, interpret, and present data effectively, and I’m excited to continue this journey in a role where I can make data-driven contributions!
